# File Storage Server Application

This project allows you to manage files on a server through a simple command-line interface (CLI). The application is structured into two main components: **Client** and **Server**. Below are the step-by-step instructions to set up and run the application, along with available functionalities.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** must be installed on your machine.
- **Node.js** and **npm** must be installed on your machine.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up the Application

### 1. Clone the Project

First, clone the project from the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
Once cloned, navigate into the project directory, which will contain two subdirectories: client and server.

Checkout the updated branches
The main development branches for this project are:

main: The primary and stable branch with the latest updates.
feature/2.0: The branch for the current feature development.

To ensure you're working with the most recent changes, you should check out these branches and pull the latest updates.

To check out the main branch:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

To check out the feature/2.0 branch:

git checkout feature/2.0
git pull origin feature/2.0

By following these steps, you will have the latest updates from the main and feature/2.0 branches.

2. Navigate to the client Folder
Change directory to the client folder:

cd client

3. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

npm install

4. Build the Docker Image
After the dependencies are installed, build the Docker image for the application using the following command:

sudo docker build -t 31081999/file-storage-client -f Dockerfile .


This will build a Docker image with the name 31081999/file-storage-client.

5. Create an Alias for Running the Application
To make it easier to run the Docker container with the correct settings, create an alias in your terminal:

alias store='docker run -it --rm 31081999/file-storage-client'


This alias allows you to run the application with the store command.

Testing the Application

The application comes with some testing files located in the client folder. These files are:

file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
file4.txt


6. View Available Commands
Now that everything is set up, run the following command to see all the available commands you can use:

store


This will display a list of commands you can use to interact with the file storage server.

Available Functionality

************************************

1. Add Files to the Server
Use the add command to add files to the server. For example, to add file1.txt and file2.txt, use:

store add file1.txt file2.txt


If the file doesn't exist on the server, it will be added.
If the file already exists with the same name, it won't be added.
If a file with the same content but a different name is added, a duplicate file will be created with the name dup<original-filename>.txt. For example, if file1.txt is already present, and you add file3.txt (which has the same content as file1.txt), it will create a duplicate file called dupfile3.txt.**BONUS TASK**

************************************

2. List All Files on the Server
Use the ls command to list all files currently stored on the server:

store ls


This will display a list of all the files that are present in the server.

***********************************


3. Remove a File from the Server
Use the rm command to delete a file from the server. For example, to remove file1.txt:

store rm file1.txt


This command will remove the specified file from the server.

***********************************


4. Update a File on the Server
Use the update command to update the content of an existing file with the content of another file. For example, to update file1.txt with the contents of file2.txt:

store update file1.txt file2.txt


If file1.txt is present, its content will be replaced with the content of file2.txt.
If file1.txt is not present, it will be added to the server.
If file1.txt and file3.txt have the same content, the file will not be updated. It will skip the update. ** BONUS TASK**

**********************************

5. Count the Total Number of Words in All Files
Use the wc command to count the total number of words in all the files stored on the server:

store wc


This will return the total word count of all files currently in the server.

**********************************


6. Find the Most or Least Frequent Words in All Files
Use the freq-words command to get the most or least frequent words in the stored files. You can specify the limit of words to return and the order (ascending or descending):

store freq-words --limit 5 --order desc


This will return the top 5 most frequent words in the files, sorted in descending order. If you want the least frequent words, change --order to asc:

store freq-words --limit 5 --order asc


This will return the least frequent words in the files, sorted in ascending order.

Optimized Word Count Functionality
To make the word count functionality more efficient, the application uses Promise.all() to count the words concurrently across all files.**BONUS TASK**

OpenShift Deployment

Backend Server Deployed in OpenShift
The backend server of this application is deployed in an OpenShift sandbox environment. After the deployment, you can access the file storage server via the following URL:

URL:
http://file-storage-server-abhi-ghosh3108-dev.apps.sandbox-m4.g2pi.p1.openshiftapps.com

I have added the resource files in the project.

Summary of Commands

Add files:
store add <file1> <file2> ...
List files:
store ls
Remove files:
store rm <filename>
Update files:
store update <oldfilename> <newfilename>
Word count:
store wc
Frequent words:
store freq-words --limit <number> --order <asc|desc>
Conclusion

This application provides a simple CLI interface to manage files on a server, allowing you to add, update, remove, and list files. Additionally, it supports word counting and finding the most or least frequent words in all files stored on the server. All of this functionality is optimized using concurrent operations (Promise.all()) to improve performance.

The backend server is deployed on OpenShift, providing a stable and scalable environment for running the file storage service.
