The rain began to fall steadily, each drop tapping softly against the windows as Maya sat alone at the old oak table in the dimly lit kitchen. The clock on the wall ticked, its hands moving slowly, as though time itself was reluctant to pass. She had always loved the sound of rain, the way it turned everything outside into a blur of gray and silver. But today, the rain felt different—heavy, almost suffocating. Her thoughts wandered, tracing back to the moment everything had changed. It seemed so distant now, yet it was still sharp in her memory, like a scar that refused to fade. The letter she had received earlier that afternoon sat on the table, its crisp, white envelope still sealed. It was from her father, who had left years ago without a word, without explanation. And now, after all this time, he had returned. Or at least, his words had. Maya didn’t know whether to feel relief or anger. Part of her had spent years wishing he would come back, hoping that one day he would explain why he left, why he never bothered to look back. But another part of her wanted to leave it all behind, to forget the empty space he had left in her heart. She reached out slowly, her fingers trembling as she picked up the letter. For a long moment, she held it, staring at the neat, unfamiliar handwriting on the front. What if this letter was another lie, another excuse? Or worse, what if it was nothing more than an apology for the pain he had caused? She didn’t know if she was strong enough to hear it. But, with a deep breath, she broke the seal and opened the letter, the silence in the room growing deeper with each passing second.
