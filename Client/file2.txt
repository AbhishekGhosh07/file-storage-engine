The forest was still, save for the occasional rustle of leaves as a breeze passed through. Sarah walked along the narrow path, her boots crunching softly against the undergrowth. The trees loomed tall around her, their branches reaching like gnarled hands toward the sky, casting long shadows over the forest floor. She hadn’t planned to come here today, but something had drawn her back. It had been years since she last ventured into these woods—since that day, the day everything had changed. She remembered it vividly: the sun setting behind the trees, the faint scent of pine in the air, and the sudden silence that had fallen, as if the forest itself had held its breath. That was the day her brother, Ethan, had vanished. No sign of struggle, no trace of where he’d gone. Just gone. She thought about him often, especially in places like this, where memories seemed to linger in the air like mist. The path ahead seemed endless, but she kept walking, driven by a need she couldn’t explain. Then, without warning, a flicker of movement caught her eye. A figure, half-hidden by the trees. Her heart raced. Could it be? Could it really be him, after all these years?
