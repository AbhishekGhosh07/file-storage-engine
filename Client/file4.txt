The city was a blur of lights and noise as Adam stepped out into the evening, his coat collar turned up against the chill. It had been a long day—longer than usual—but the tension in his shoulders wouldn’t ease. The streets were crowded, people rushing past him in a hurry, lost in their own worlds. But for Adam, everything felt distant, as if he were watching from the outside, disconnected from the frantic energy around him. He glanced up at the towering buildings, their windows glowing like eyes in the dark, and for a moment, he wondered if anyone else felt the way he did—like they were carrying the weight of something just beyond reach. It had been months since he’d heard from Lucy, and the silence had only grown heavier with time. They’d promised to stay in touch, to not let the distance between them become a barrier. But promises, it seemed, were fragile things. He pulled his phone from his pocket, staring at the screen for a long moment, before slipping it back into his coat. Maybe it was time to let go. But as he turned down a quieter street, a sudden flash of memory hit him: her laugh, the way her eyes sparkled when she was excited. It wasn’t something he could forget so easily.
